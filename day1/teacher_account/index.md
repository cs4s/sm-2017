# Scratch Teacher Accounts Activity

## About

In this activity we will introduce you to Teacher Accounts in Scratch.
A Teacher Account allows you to manage Classes of students and can make common administrative tasks, for example: setting up students' accounts and changing their passwords, easier.
We highly recommend requesting a Teacher Account on the Scratch website, if you are going to begin using the online version of Scratch with your students. 

This activity includes examples of how to use the important features of Teacher Accounts, including:

- Creating a new *Class*
- Adding *Students* to a *Class*
- Creating *Studios* for a *Class*
- Changing *Students'* passwords
- Viewing your *Students'* activity on Scratch

Teacher Accounts in Scratch are relatively new, so there may be changes to the Teacher Account features or new features introduced soon.
For more information about what Teacher Accounts can and cannot do, and the changes that are planned for the future, we recommend reading the [Scratch Teacher Account FAQ](https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/faq){:target="_blank"}.
