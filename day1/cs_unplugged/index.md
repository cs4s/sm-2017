# Computer Science Unplugged

## About

As you know, Computer Science (CS) is not just about coding! 
Computational thinking and algorithmic thinking are at the core of CS and many of its principles can be taught without the aid of a computer.
The activities in this session are designed for "rainy days" when things may go wrong and computers are not available.

In this session we will work through two Computer Science Unplugged (CSUnplugged) activities: Binary Numbers and Image Representation.
CSUnplugged is a set of free resources for teaching Computer Science concepts without using a computer.
