# Coding in Scratch

## About

In this activity we will learn about Scratch and the following fundamental Coding concepts:

- *Algorithms and Programs*
- *Sequencing*
- *Repetition*
- *Variables*
- *User Input*
- *Branching*

The purpose of this activity is to familiarise you with Scratch, as well as to introduce you to the above concepts.

We have also included a [Glossary page]({{ site.baseurl | append: site.glossary_path }}), which provides a list of key terms (including the concepts listed above) used in the workshops' activities and their meanings.

The *Dancing Cat program* that is referred to in the activity can [be viewed on this website](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173543499/){:target="_blank"}.
