# Combining Coding and Maths

## About

In this session, we will discuss how Coding can potentially enhance the learning of Maths and give examples of some prominent authors and researchers that have worked in this field.
We will also give a couple of examples of how Coding has been combined with Maths in practice.

If you are interested in learning more about Coding to learning Maths, we have included links to some relevant books under the *Books - Coding & Math* heading on the [Resources]({{ site.baseurl | append: site.resources_path }}) page.
