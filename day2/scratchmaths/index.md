# ScratchMaths Module 1

In the Day 2 sessions, we will work through Module 1 of the [ScratchMaths Curriculum Materials](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/research/projects/scratchmaths/curriculum-materials){:target="_blank"}.
Module 1 is split into four separate investigation activities.
The different investigations are described below and the links to relevant files for each investigation are listed under the *Files* headings.

We recommend that you download all of the materials at the start of Day 2, however:

## Investigation 1: Moving, Turning and Stamping

### About

In this investigation you will learn how to:

- create a symmetrical pattern with *Sprites* and the *stamp* block
- use the *move* and *turn* blocks with the *stamp* block to make patterns
- save a picture of a pattern to a file
- identify when scripts can be simplified

## Investigation 2: Repeating and Alternating Patterns

### About

In this investigation you will learn how to:

- run a script several times with a *repeat* block
- use the *next costume* block to change a *Sprite's* costume
- create patterns by using the *stamp* block and alternating a *Sprite's* costumes

## Investigation 3: Creating Circular Rose Patterns

### About

In this investigation you will learn how to:

- create circular patterns from the central point
- combine different rose patterns together
- interpret scripts for drawing rose patterns and predict their results
- use the *switch costume to* block to make a variety of rose patterns

## Investigation 4: Defining your own Pattern Blocks

### About

In this investigation you will learn how to:

- define and use *custom blocks*
- combine *custom blocks* with *repetition* and other *custom blocks* to create more complex patterns
